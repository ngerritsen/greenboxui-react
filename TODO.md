##Scrumboard Greenbox UI

###Progressgit
- Build Controls component (w/ store(s) for parameters)
  * Be able to control specific control
  * Be able to (fake) set new setpoints
  * Implement read-only/hidden/write-able parameters
- Refactor naming conventions (for instance, on-prefix for action handlers)

###Backlog
- Immutable for shared components, actions?
- More easy mixin for listening to stores?
- Build Log component
- Make graph with actual data
- Hook up to real greenbox
- Experiment /w aria
